# Project Description for CV

## Real-Time Data Pipeline with Modern Big Data Stack

**Duration:** July 2025  
**Technologies:** Apache Airflow, Kafka, Druid, Superset, Spark, Docker, Python, PostgreSQL, Redis  
**Data Sources:** GOES Satellite Data (CITIC - Universidad de Costa Rica), Financial APIs, Weather APIs

### Project Summary

Designed and implemented a comprehensive real-time data pipeline for processing satellite telemetry and financial market data using modern open-source big data technologies. The system demonstrates enterprise-grade data engineering practices with end-to-end automation, real-time streaming, and interactive visualization capabilities.

### Key Achievements

• **Architected scalable data pipeline** processing 10,000+ messages/second using Apache Kafka and Druid, achieving <10 seconds end-to-end latency for real-time satellite data ingestion

• **Integrated external data sources** including GOES satellite NetCDF files from CITIC repository, cryptocurrency market data, and meteorological information through automated ETL workflows

• **Built containerized microservices architecture** using Docker Compose with 8+ interconnected services (Airflow, Kafka, Druid, Superset, Spark, PostgreSQL, Redis) for high availability and scalability

• **Developed 5+ Airflow DAGs** for workflow orchestration, including complex satellite data processing pipelines that automatically download, parse, and stream NetCDF scientific datasets

• **Implemented real-time analytics** with Apache Druid for time-series data storage and Apache Superset for interactive dashboards, enabling sub-second query response times on large datasets

• **Established data quality monitoring** with comprehensive logging, error handling, and pipeline health metrics to ensure 99%+ data processing reliability

### Technical Highlights

**Data Engineering:** Designed ETL pipelines processing scientific NetCDF files with 30+ variables per dataset, implementing data validation, transformation, and enrichment using Python, Pandas, and NumPy

**Stream Processing:** Built Kafka-based streaming architecture handling multiple data topics with configurable partitioning, replication, and fault tolerance for high-throughput message processing

**Database Management:** Configured PostgreSQL for metadata storage and Redis for caching, optimizing query performance and session management across distributed services

**DevOps & Infrastructure:** Deployed full stack using Infrastructure as Code principles with Docker Compose, implementing service discovery, load balancing, and automated health checks

**API Integration:** Developed robust external API integrations with proper error handling, rate limiting, and retry mechanisms for cryptocurrency and weather data sources

**Data Visualization:** Created interactive dashboards in Apache Superset with real-time time-series charts, geographic visualizations, and business intelligence reporting capabilities

### Business Impact

This project demonstrates proficiency in modern data engineering practices essential for enterprise data platforms, including real-time processing, microservices architecture, and scientific data handling. The pipeline successfully processes actual satellite data from academic institutions, showcasing ability to work with complex scientific datasets and external data sources in production-grade environments.
